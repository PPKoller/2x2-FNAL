\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

DUNE is a highly ambitious next-generation accelerator neutrino oscillation experiment~\cite{DUNE, DUNE2}. DUNE will utilise an intense beam of predominantly muon (anti)neutrinos produced at Fermilab, will sample the unoscillated beam on the Fermilab site, 574m from the proton target, and then will sample the unoscillated beam 1300km away at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, using 4 10kt liquid argon (LAr) target modules. By using LAr time projection chambers (TPCs), DUNE benefits from the exquisite precision to look at the particles escaping the nucleus, and measuring the neutrino energies with unparalleled precision. An extensive research and development (R\&D) program is currently ongoing to deliver detectors capable of fulfilling DUNE's physics goals. The unprecedented size of the DUNE far detectors~\cite{DUNE_IDR_v1, DUNE_IDR_v2, DUNE_IDR_v3} has motivated large-scale LAr TPC tests, in the single- and dual-phase ProtoDUNE modules in CERN~\cite{Abi:2017aow, Agostino:2014qoa}, in themselves, the largest LAr TPCs built to date.

As the DUNE far detectors have LAr targets, it is highly desirable to also have a major LAr component for the DUNE near detector suite, in order to minimize cross section and detector systematic uncertainties for oscillation analyses~\cite{DUNE, DUNE2}. However, the intense neutrino flux and high event rate at the near detector makes traditional, monolithic, projective wire readout TPCs unsuitable, which has motivated a program of R\&D into a new LAr TPC approach, suitable for such a high rate environment, known as ArgonCube~\cite{argoncube_loi}. ArgonCube utilizes detector modularization to improve drift field stability, reduces the stored energy, and improves the liquid argon purity; it uses a pixelized charge readout~\cite{pixels, larpix}, which provides true 3D imaging of particle interactions, free from the ambiguities present from traditional wire plane readout systems, which use multiple 2D projections, and drastically simplifying the reconstruction; and new dielectric light detection techniques with ArCLight~\cite{arclight}, which can be placed inside the field cage to increase light yield, and localization of light signals. Additionally, ArgonCube uses a resistive field shell, instead of traditional field shaping rings, to minimize the dead material and maximize active volume, and to reduce the risk of breakdown due to the resistor chain, and to minimize the power release in the event of a breakdown~\addcite. Such an optically segmented, pixel readout LAr TPC has been recommended as the major LAr component for the DUNE near detector by the DUNE Near Detector Concept Study Group~\cite{dune_ndcsg}.

Early investigations into long drift lengths and high electric fields with the ArgonTube detector~\cite{argontube_design} found a number of technical issues and a higher than expected risk of breakdowns~\cite{argontube}, as well as testing cryogenic charge readout electronics~\cite{art_cold_ero}. Smaller, modular LAr TPCs were introduced as a robust solution to the high voltage problem, which reduces the LAr purity requirements due to the short drift lengths. The feasibility of pixelated readout was demonstrated using a 60-cm-drift pixel TPC located at the University of Bern in 2016~\cite{pixels}. LArIAT~\cite{lariat} has since operated a scaled-up version of this readout technique (renamed PixLAr) at Fermilab in 2017. Recent developments to the LArPix pixel readout electronics made at LBNL have removed the ambiguities present for the earlier tests~\cite{larpix}. The 60-cm-drift pixel TPC was used to demonstrate amplification and digitization in the cold at LBNL, with the updated LArPix electronics~\cite{larpix}. A field-shell demonstrator TPC was tested successfully at the University of Bern in 2018~\addcite \todo{4th module paper when it's available}. Tests of the ArCLight dielectric photon detector have also been carried out in LAr, as described in Ref.~\cite{arclight}. With the various technological developments demonstrated with small-scale TPCs, the next necessary step in the ArgonCube program is to demonstrate the scalability of the pixelized charge readout and light detection systems, and to show that information from separate modules can be combined to produce high quality event reconstruction for particle interactions. To that end, a mid-scale (1.4m $\times$ 1.4m $\times$ 1.2m) modular TPC, dubbed the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator module, with 4 independent LAr TPC modules arranged in a 2x2 grid has been designed, and is currently under construction at the University of Bern. Given the environment that the DUNE near detector will operate in, it is desirable to operate the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator in an intense, few-GeV, neutrino beam.

In this document, we propose moving the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator module into the NuMI on-axis neutrino beamline at FNAL, to serve as a prototype for the near detector, or ProtoDUNE-ND. A detailed description of the proposed location and the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator module can be found in Section~\ref{sec:protodune-nd}. Add a comment about HPTPC and 3DST if they will be able to form a part of this proposal. If not, I guess we should comment on the general multi-detector ND design, but not go into details. {\it If we ultimately do not include anything other than the 2x2, we should comment on the location of MINERvA/MINOS-ND in the hall, and the possibility to test reconstruction with multiple detectors... maybe that's a useful think to also test?} A description of the detector physics studies to be performed in Section~\ref{sec:detector-physics-studies}. The outlook for the test modules and a timeline in Section~\ref{sec:outlook}. {\it Probably want to have a strong show of support from FNAL in this section --- e.g. if they propose concrete infrastructure support, it should go here, as well as in the description of the location for the test.} Conclusions are presented in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.\\\\

\todo{The last paragraph will need to be reworked to include the HPTPC and/or the 3DST if possible. If not, I guess we leave it open, and suggest they can add something if there is time.}
