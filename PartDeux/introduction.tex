\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this document, we propose moving the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator into the NuMI on-axis neutrino beamline at FNAL, to serve as the core of a prototype for the near detector, or ProtoDUNE-ND. This is in analogy to the successful ProtoDUNE program for the far detector. A detailed description of the proposed location and the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator module can be found in Section~\ref{sec:protodune-nd}. A description of the detector physics studies to be performed with the 2x2 alone is given in Section~\ref{sec:detector-physics-studies}. Additional detector physics possibilities if a downstream tracker is added to ProtoDUNE-ND are described in Section~\ref{sec:MINERvA_MINOS}, with the option of repurposing existing MINERVA and/or MINOS ND hardware is discussed. The outlook for the test modules and a timeline in Section~\ref{sec:outlook}. Conclusions are presented in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
