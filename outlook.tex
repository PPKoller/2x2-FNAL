\section{Outlook and timeline}
\label{sec:outlook}
To provide some context for the aggressive schedule of the 2x2 and ProtoDUNE-ND: the CDR for the DUNE ND is be submitted in April of 2019, with the TDR to be submitted in April of the following year~\cite{dune_dates}, with installation due to begin in 2025. 

The 2x2 construction and commissioning will take place in Bern, before the detector is moved to Fermilab. To date, the various technologies have been demonstrated in small test stands, the next step is to test the module construction techniques. Once this is complete, the technologies can be scaled to populate a 2x2 module.      

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf December 2018:} Complete cryostat instrumentation and infrastructure: for cryogenic control systems and slow control monitoring. 
\item {\bf January 2019:} Tests of the cryogenics and the purity module will be performed by the end of 2018. Extraction and reinsertion of a test module  with the argon recirculation system will be performed. This will check that the argon purification system works as expected for the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator module, and will help inform the final design choice of the full-size ArgonCube, for which different potential purification systems are being considered (see Section~\ref{sec:2x2-design})..
\item {\bf June 2019:} all four modules completed.
\item {\bf June--August 2019:} tests of the complete ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator to be performed at the University of Bern. Verification that the slow control works as expected. Basic DAQ tests, and cosmic muon sample collected.
\item {\bf December 2019:} transport the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator to FNAL
\item {\bf January--February 2019:} detector commissioning at FNAL.
\item {\bf March 2019:} ready to take data.
\item \todo{This timeline is very tentative, we should definitely note when the summer NuMI shutdown is here to show how much leeway there is for timing}
\end{itemize}
