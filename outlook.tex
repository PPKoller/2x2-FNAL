\section{Outlook and timeline}
\label{sec:outlook}
To provide some context for the aggressive schedule of the 2x2 and ProtoDUNE-ND: the CDR for the DUNE ND is be submitted in April of 2019, with the TDR to be submitted in April of the following year~\cite{dune_dates}, with installation due to begin in 2025. 

The 2x2 construction and commissioning will take place in Bern, before the detector is moved to Fermilab. To date, the various technologies have been demonstrated in small test stands, the next step is to test the module construction techniques. Once this is complete, the technologies can be scaled to populate a 2x2 module. The following is a very simplified timeline with major milestones:      

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf December 2018:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bern: Complete cryostat instrumentation and infrastructure: for cryogenic control systems and slow control monitoring. 
\item LBNL: LArPix V2 design to vendor. Packaging test with LArPix V1
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf January 2019:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bern: Test of first module, demonstrate purity can be maintained, confirm material choices, optimize cooling control and slow monitoring system.   
	\item LBNL: LArPix V2 review meeting. LArPix V2 Production.
	\item FNAL: Control system development (PLC). Determine cryogenic infrastructure requirements at FNAL (ODH), and cost estimate.  
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf February 2019:} FNAL: Cryogenic review meeting.  
\item {\bf March 2019:} Bern: Deploy FNAL PLC. Collaboration meeting, finalize module design and outline construction workload across collaboration.    
\item {\bf April 2019:} FNAL: Review MINOS ND hall installation concept.
\item {\bf June 2019:} Preliminary MINOS ND hall installation plan.
\item {\bf July 2019:} LBNL: testing of LArPix V2 on pixel PCB.
\item {\bf September/October 2019:} Bern: module construction begins.
 \item {\bf November 2019:}Bern: Module deployment 
\item {\bf December 2019:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bern: Cosmic run  2x2, DAQ tests and develop simple reconstruction tools.   
	\item FNAL: Review installation design.  
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf January 2020:} Bern: Shipping to FNAL.
\item {\bf February 2020:} FNAL: 2x2 assembly and installation.
\item {\bf May 2020:} FNAL: 2x2 commissioning.    
\item {\bf October 2020:} FNAL: Detector operation.

\end{itemize}
