\section{Outlook and timeline}
\label{sec:outlook}

\todo{Add dates for FNAL local infrastructure to be completed}\\
\todo{Add relevant dates for HPTPC/3DST if relevant, or branch points for decisions to be made if they cannot be ready in time}\\
\todo{Are there relevant LArPix dates to be included here? -- Dan}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf December 2018:} complete remaining R\&D tests to be carried out before the 2x2 is built. Two outstanding tests planned:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Although initial tests with a resistive field shell were successful with a small TPC~\cite{argoncube_fd}, a test with a larger TPC with a resistive field shell will be carried out at the University of Bern by the end of 2018. The primary purpose will be to conduct a studies of breakdown studies, to investigate the power dissipation and whether the field shell is damaged in the event of a breakdown, as well as to check the field uniformity and stability. If for whatever reason a problem is found with the resistive field shell design for the 2x2, the backup option will be to revert to using a field cage, as in Ref.~\cite{argoncube_loi}.
  \item Tests of the cryogenics and the purity module will be performed by the end of 2018. Extraction and reinsertion of a test module with the argon recirculation system will be performed. This will check that the argon purification system works as expected for the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator module, and will help inform the final design choice of the full-size ArgonCube, for which different potential purification systems are being considered (see Section~\ref{sec:2x2-design}).
  \end{enumerate}
\item {\bf January 2019:} first module for the 2x2 complete, ready for first local ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator tests.
\item {\bf June 2019:} all four modules completed.
\item {\bf June--August 2019:} tests of the complete ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator to be performed at the University of Bern. Verification that the slow control works as expected. Basic DAQ tests, and cosmic muon sample collected.
\item {\bf December 2019:} transport the ArgonCube 2x2 Demonstrator to FNAL
\item {\bf January--February 2019:} detector commissioning at FNAL.
\item {\bf March 2019:} ready to take data.
\item \todo{This timeline is obviously very tentative, but we should definitely check what the NuMI run plan is... there's not much point pushing an ambitious schedule if we arrive in a long shutdown}
\end{itemize}
