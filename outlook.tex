\section{Outlook and timeline}
\label{sec:outlook}

\begin{itemize}
\item R\&D tests yet to be done before the 2x2 is built
\item Times for building 2x2 modules
\item Local 2x2 tests to be done
\item Time to start preparing the facility --- we're aiming for mid-2020 running, so late 2019 installation in FNAL
\item Any points from the other subdetector components
\item What are the branch points for decisions to be made regarding other subdetectors?
\end{itemize}
